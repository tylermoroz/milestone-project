        <h1><a name="about">About Me</a></h1>
        <p> Hi, my name is Tyler and after months of consideration I finally decided to jump into the tech industry. I've always had an interest in technology and how systems work and how they're created so I decided to give it a shot! I have so many interests that it's difficult to find time to fit them into my life, it's kind of annoying to be completely honest. Even with that being a struggle, it keeps me busy and I'm thankful in that regard, I just wish there were more hours in the day to fulfill all my desires.</p>
        <p>I have a unique obsession with figuring things out and the satisfaction that comes with it so with that being a crucial part of learning how to code I think I have found my calling. I grew up playing football and working out to become better at it. So I am conditioned when it comes to adapting with the ever-advancing tech industry and knowing what exactly I need to work on to become more successful and being in that team environment and overcoming adversity helps me too. Science and technology have always been a passion of mine and I'm always looking for the newest innovation and scientific discovery. I would love nothing more than to some day create my own and hopefully have a positive impact on society.</p>
